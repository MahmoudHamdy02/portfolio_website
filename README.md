# Outdated
This page was hosted on heroku before they took down the free tier. I haven't hosted this somewhere else as this page is old and not representative of my current web dev experience

It is built with Django in the backend, and vanilla JS in the frontend. 

This website was a way to practice web development, but the plan is to expand it in the future by implementing React or Angular.
